              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. Data is managed through Supabase for reliable
                group coordination while maintaining privacy. The app works entirely in your browser with
                no server-side user tracking.

              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-3">From the author</h2>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-2">
                This project came about due to a random request from my sister to hunt for a tool that could help her organize Secret Santa groups.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-2">
                I then took this as an opportunity to conduct an experiment: How far can I take an AI tool (GitHub Copilot) to write code for me without me intervening and writing it myself.
                As it turns out, very far!
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-2">
                You see, this application is written virtually by AI &mdash; everything from front-end logic to backend triggers.
                I haven&apos;t written a line of code in this project apart from this small section here on the About page and a couple of Supabase client code I copied from a previous project.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-2">
                Most of the time I spent is on writing prompts, reviewing the changes, accepting some changes, and refining the rest with further prompts.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-2">
                Notice the &quot;Add Wish Lists&quot; feature it hallucinated? I figured to keep it for illustration purposes and just ask GitHub Copilot to add a disclaimer there.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-2">
                Am I satisfied with the end result? On the backend side, absolutely! That part took the most scrutiny from me.
                As for the frontend, I&apos;ll admit I still feel uneasy about the fact that I just blindly accepted the suggested code based on how it looked on the browser.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-2">
                Anyway, this whole project/experiment has been fun and I am very happy that I have something to show for, considering that it only took about a day to complete.
